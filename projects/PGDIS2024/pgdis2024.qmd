## PGT-A {.smaller}
### [Ion ReproSeqâ„¢ PGS](https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-applications/reproductive-health-research/preimplantation-genetic-testing/preimplantation-genetic-screening.html)
- Detect whole-chromosome, mosaic, and small copy number events with just 6 pg of DNA from single or multiple cells
- Multiple kit configurations to analyze from 16 to 192 samples in a single run
- Mosaicism detection, gender masking, and improved data plotting (for easier data interpretation)
- Together with the _Ion AmpliSeqâ„¢ Polyploidy Panel_ can confidently identify triploidy 69, XXX, assess potential maternal contamination, and track sibling samples, preventing sample mix-ups.
- Turnaround time for the Ion ReproSeq PGS Kit 16 samples/run is <10 hours with <2 hours of hands on time.

## PGT-M
#### [PGD-SEQâ„¢ Panel and Reagent Kits](https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-applications/reproductive-health-research/preimplantation-genetic-testing/targeted-ngs-monogenic.html)
- \>500 gene panels for common and rare monogenic diseases for IVF 
- Complete kit reagents and targeted PGT-M library to analyze 15 samples
- Comprehensive familial carrier status using proprietary linkage analysis software
- >**Simultaneous PGT-M and PGT-A using a single embryo biopsy**


## Mosasic transfer

- \>99% of live births from mosaic embryos transfer have no detectable abnormalities (Note the prerequisites of ongoing
pregnancy, i.e. no implantation failure, no miscarriage)
- Low-level mosaicism has a better outcome for implantation and pregnancy. But mosiac level "currenly" does not predict
the risk of being in the <1% of live births with abnormalities.


## de novo mutations 
Long-read sequencing (and direct haplotyping) when incomplete pedigree, de novo mutations (Yikon).

## AI
#### re-classification of mosaic embryos
- Mosasic Resolution by Decompositon 
- Clinical and theoretical decomposition to estimate mosaicism
- Copy number variation (CNV) and allelic balance

#### Grading embryos
AI embryo image analysis

## Non-invasive PGT (niPGT)
- During in vitro development, mostly from day 4 to 6, embryo cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released to the culture medium, with higher concentrations as the number of cells increase at blastocyst.
- informativity rates on D6: 98.8% (D5: 81.8%)
- ploidy concordance TE on D6: 89.1% (D5: 76%)
- concordance rate with full frozen blastocyst/ICM: up to 93.7% D6/7
