## PGT-A {.smaller}
### [Ion ReproSeq PGS](https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-applications/reproductive-health-research/preimplantation-genetic-testing/preimplantation-genetic-screening.html)
- Detect whole-chromosome, mosaic, and small copy number events with just 6 pg of DNA from single or multiple cells
- Multiple kit configurations to analyze from 16 to 192 samples in a single run
- Mosaicism detection, gender masking, and improved data plotting (for easier data interpretation)
- Together with the _Ion AmpliSeq Polyploidy Panel_ can confidently identify triploidy 69, XXX, assess potential maternal contamination, and track sibling samples, preventing sample mix-ups.
- Turnaround time for the Ion ReproSeq PGS Kit 16 samples/run is <10 hours with <2 hours of hands on time.

## PGT-M
### [PGD-SEQ Panel and Reagent Kits](https://www.thermofisher.com/no/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-applications/reproductive-health-research/preimplantation-genetic-testing/targeted-ngs-monogenic.html)
- \>500 gene panels for common and rare monogenic diseases for IVF 
- Complete kit reagents and targeted PGT-M library to analyze 15 samples
- Comprehensive familial carrier status using proprietary linkage analysis software
- >**Simultaneous PGT-M and PGT-A using a single embryo biopsy**
