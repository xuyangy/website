It can reach 90% of a single core.\n\nDoes increasing the chunk size of s3cmd improve the transfer speed?\n\nThe 200MB chunk size is almost the optimal size for the current setup. 2500MB chunk size is slightly better (+10%) than 200MB chunk size for very large files.\n\nDoes parallelizing the transfer improve the transfer speed?\n\nWith two parallel nsc-exporter processes, we can achieve around 1.6x - 1.8x the transfer speed of a single process."

The nsc-exporter normally takes a snapshot of new data and transfer it. It then sleeps for 10 minutes before checking for new data. The slept times counted here are where next sleep is more than the sleeping interval (10 minutes) later, signifying that new data comes right after the sleep. This is contrary to long idle time where no new data comes after the sleep.↩︎\nTo make sure files are transferred intact, s3cmd put checks the md5sum of the files. This takes time and is not reported as transfer time by s3cmd The md5sum check is done before starting the transfer. We estimate the md5sum check time by subtracting the transfer time from the time gap between two transfers. The md5sum check time is usually less than 10 minutes, so a gap larger than 10 minutes is not considered as md5sum check time.↩︎\nEffective transfer time is calculated as “absolute transfer time” + “sleep time between 2 transfers” + “md5sum check time”.↩︎"
