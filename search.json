This is the configured chunk size of s3cmd which is the tool used for data transfer. We might want to increase the chunk size to improve the transfer speed?\nThe current transfer speed is not optimal considering the 10Gbps switch connecting NSC and TSD. We need to investigate the reason for the low transfer speed.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Conclusion\n\nWe might be able to run 4 x 48 or 2 x 48 + 1 x 96 samples per week with the current transfer speed. However, we will reach maximum capicity of data transfer.\nIf we can increase the transfer speed, e.g.Â reaching 200MB/s, we can easily double current production capacity."
